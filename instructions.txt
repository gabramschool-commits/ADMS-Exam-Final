use pandas for simpler data transformation
Data exist in the staging, transformation, and presentation layers. These represent sample expected outcomes of the ETL process.
and you are free to adjust or enhance them as you see fit.

Source Datasets:
	Japan Store
	Myanmar Store

	from source to staging area
	Load both source datasets from CSV files into the SQL database.

Transform
	from staging area to transformation area
	Perform data cleaning (removing nulls, correcting data types, handling inconsistencies).
	Standardize values across datasets (e.g., Japan store item prices in JPY and Myanmar store item prices in USD are converted to a common currency or format).

Load
	from transformation area to presentation area
	Combine the transformed datasets into a single consolidated table in the SQL database.
